### Data Visualization

#### Social data projects #MakeoverMonday and #DiversityinData
During my semester abroad in Germany, I took a 2-day course in **Data Visualization** and attended a guest lecture by two representatives from Tableau Germany. So I started 2021 by learning how to use Tableau and decided to try out challenges by _#makeovermonday_. Lucky as I am, I am featured among the **favourites** for the first week of 2021 by the author of the initiative, Eva Murray!

## About myself

Growing up in the vibrant city of Hanoi, I have always enjoyed working together with others and being in a team with a purpose to do something great. Since my high school years, I have been trusted with leadership roles in various student organizations, such as the [Applied Science Organization](https://www.facebook.com/aso.csp) in Hanoi, Vietnam. This passion of mine grew even more as I moved abroad to pursue my studies. At the [Erasmus Student Network Tartu](https://www.facebook.com/ESNTartuPage), I lead and participated in the organization of 11 events for hundreds of exchange students coming to Tartu, Estonia. I was also one of the two leaders for the preparation of the first webinar hosted by [AIESEC Estonia](https://www.aiesec.ee), which attracted over 60 participants.
