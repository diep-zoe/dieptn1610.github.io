#### Singflower Case with Tree and Random Forest
Mark Li, the head of innovation of Singflower, suggested using drones to take pictures of the flowers. With these pictures, Mark Li aims to train a model that detects which flowers are over/under/well watered before it is too late. If Mark Li succeeds in his purpose, he will be able to reduce the amount of dead iris. This can trigger an increase in production at Singflower and/or the development of a new product.
