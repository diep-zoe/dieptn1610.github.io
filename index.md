### Data Visualization

#### Social data projects #MakeoverMonday and #DiversityinData
During my semester abroad in Germany, I took a 2-day course in **Data Visualization** and attended a guest lecture by two representatives from **Tableau Germany**. So I started 2021 by learning how to use Tableau and decided to try out challenges by #makeovermonday. Lucky as I am, I am featured among the **favourites** for the first week of 2021 by the author of the initiative, Eva Murray!
